neighborhood app

- Study Buddy

-This app searches and database that is hardcoded to be created upon installation. The database is only created once as shared preferences are used to not contiue to add to the database when "SearchActivity" is destroyed and creataed.
-There are three search types that can be carried out. A traditional criteria search that captures user input to serach and return results orderd by distance from the user. There is also a buddy search. With one button a user can pull up a result list of all the buddies they have saved. The final serach type is through the search option on the menu. This search is for finding specific users.
-The logged in user also has the ability to add and remove their saved interest. There is an edit button on the menu bar that brings the user to their interests detail activity. From there the user can delete with a long click or add with the FAB button.

- known bugs

-this app doens't have a login screen. One user is always logged in.
-the user would need the ability to suggest to the developer more Subjects, and levels because they were hard coded to make searching easier and more efficient.
